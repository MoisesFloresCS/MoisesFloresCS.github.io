            Hi! Thank you for visiting my page! It is a work in progress. I grew up in the San Fernando Valley with a loving family. In high school, I had met one of my first mentors that introduced me to computer science. I was immediately interested and I set my sights on becoming a great developer one day. Fast foward a few years later, and I am still working everyday to achieve that goal. I love to learn from books, people, and podcasts.
